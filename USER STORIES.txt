US1: As a user, I want to see a play button that I can click so that I can start a game. 
	
US2: As a user, on click of "One Player", I want to see a game board with 10 rows of holes so that 
	I have places to put my guesses.

	guesses once I have made them.
	
US4: As a user, I want to see a taskbar at the bottom of the screen with each colored peg so
	that I can decide which pegs to place on the board.
	
US5: As a user, I want to be able to drag and drop pegs on the game board so that I can make and
	visualize my guesses.
	
US6: As a user, I want the game to generate a random set of four pegs for me to guess.
	
US7: As a user, I want to click the check mark after making my four-peg guess to submit it and
	allow me to make another guess in the next row.

	so that the app is more user friendly.
