US1: As a user, I want to see play options such as one or two player modes on game load 
	so that I can choose which mode to play. Non-functional buttons will be labeled "COMING SOON".
	
	1.1. As a user, on click of "One Player", I want to see a game board with 10 rows of holes so that 
		I have places to put my guesses.
	1.2. As a user, I want to scroll up and down the game board so I can each row and revisit my
		guesses once I have made them.
	1.3. As a user, I want to see a taskbar at the bottom of the screen with each colored peg so
		that I can decide which pegs to place on the board.
	1.4. As a user, I want to be able to drag and drop pegs on the game board so that I can make and
		visualize my guesses. (US3)
	
US2: As a user, I want the game to generate a random set of four pegs for me to guess.
	
US3: As a user, I want to be able to drag and drop my pins for my guesses 
	so that the game is more engaging/easy to use.
	
	3.1 As a user, I want to click the checkmark after making my four-peg guess to submit it and
		allow me to make another guess in the next row. 
	
US4: As a user, I want to receive correct feedback on my guesses 
	so that I know what I need to fix.
	
US6: As a user, I want simple navigation between main screens, with helpful/catchy graphics 
	so that the app is more user friendly.
